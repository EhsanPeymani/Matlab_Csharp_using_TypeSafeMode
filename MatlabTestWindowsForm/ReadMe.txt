Create the interface
Compile the interface and use it while compiling the matlab files

When you want to call the matlab functions, you need to make references to the following:
-- the interface project you have built
-- the Native dll file created by matlab compiler
-- the interfcace dll file (this is build like [ClassName][InterfaceName])
